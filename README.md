# github-labels

My attempt to make managing github's labels easier. This repository contains Bourne shell scripts, which implement some of [the official GitHub API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/).

You shall run `init.sh` script to see the options.
You also may see the list of implemented functions in the `api.sh` script.
